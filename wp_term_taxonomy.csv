"933","906","category","Hydraulic fracturing – fracking – is a mining technique that, together with horizontal drilling, enables access to natural gas and petroleum deposits in deep rock formations that can’t be reached by more traditional methods. Liquid, generally water, is mixed with chemicals and sand and then injected under high pressure into a well. This makes tiny fractures in the rock along which gas, petroleum and the leftover liquid migrate into the well. Pressure is then removed, and small grains of sand or aluminum oxide are injected to keep the fractures open.","0","9"

"14265","14163","category","NASA is testing an Em Drive engine which provides thrust by bouncing microwaves around in a closed container. Solar energy can provide the electricity to power the microwaves, so no propellant is needed. The concept contravenes the accepted laws of physics, as its allegedly fuel-free nature would produce a forward-facing force without an equal and opposite force acting in the other direction.  It may lead to humans traveling further into space, generating their own propulsion on the way.","0","1"
